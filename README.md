Title: ZaraÂ´s template in HTML

In the present work, an HTML template of the Zara website will be created where you can see its structure in a simple way. To have the reference of the page, a screenshot of it was taken and a graphic was created with boxes, name and colors that identify its content.

The Zara website was used: https://www.zara.com/co/ (The images used to make the HTML template are in the "images" folder)
